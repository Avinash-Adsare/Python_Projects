Task:
Imagine you are hired by a small cafe called “Biscotti Cafe” to automate their day-to-day
operations.
- The cafe has a limited menu for now (mentioned below).
- The place has only 6 tables.
- Only one person waits on the tables (two parallel orders cannot be placed).
Menu:
- Coffee
- Tea
- Sandwich
- Burger
- Fries
- Cake
(*you are free to create your own menu; add/subtract any item you like/dislike. Set your own
prices for each food item.)
Your Job:
Automate the order placement and bill generation process of Biscotti Cafe using Python
Programming Language. The flow will roughly look like this.
- The user (the waiter in our case) will open an Order for one Table.
- The user will input a list of food items + individual quantities for that Order (based on
customer’s choice).
- Example: For Table 1, Order 1 - Coffee 2, Tea 1, Sandwich 2.
- The customer at that particular Table can order more food items later. So, the active
Order will not close until the user does so specifically.
- Once closed, the program will fetch prices of the respective food items from its memory
and calculate a net bill payable for this Order placed on a particular Table.
Note: Take user input through the terminal and display your results in the terminal. Try making
the interface as user-friendly as possible.
